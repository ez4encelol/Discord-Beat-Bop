# 🎶 Discord Youtube Bot
This Discord bot allows users to play YouTube audio, manage a music queue, adjust volume, loop songs, and control playback directly from a voice channel using text commands.

It uses:

discord.js for Discord integration

@discordjs/voice for voice playback

yt-dlp to stream YouTube audio

ffmpeg for audio processing

🚀 Features
🔊 Stream YouTube audio directly into voice channels

⏱ Maintain a queue of songs per server

🔁 Loop the current track

⏸ Pause/resume playback

⏭ Skip current track

🎚 Control volume

❌ Stop and disconnect from voice

🧹 Clear the music queue

# 💬 Commands
All commands start with !

Command	Description
!play <url>	Plays the YouTube audio from the given link. Adds to the queue if something is already playing.
!skip	Skips the current track.
!loop	Toggles looping the currently playing song.
!pause	Pauses the current playback.
!resume	Resumes playback if paused.
!volume <0.0–2.0>	Sets the playback volume (1.0 = 100%, 0.5 = 50%, 2.0 = 200%).
!stop	Stops playback and disconnects from the voice channel.
!clear	Clears the current music queue (does not stop the currently playing song).

# 🎧 How It Works
When a user types !play <YouTube URL> in a text channel:

If nothing is playing, the bot joins the user's voice channel and plays the audio.

If something is already playing, it adds the song to the queue.

The bot uses yt-dlp to stream raw audio from YouTube and pipes it through ffmpeg to Discord.

Commands like !skip, !loop, !pause, and !volume manipulate the current playback or queue.

If looping is enabled via !loop, the same song repeats when it ends.

The bot automatically leaves the voice channel when playback ends and the queue is empty.

✅ Node.js

✅ yt-dlp
