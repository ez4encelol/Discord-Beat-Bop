# Discord Youtube Bot

## Overview

This Discord bot allows users to **play YouTube audio**, manage a **music queue**, adjust **volume**, loop songs, and control playback directly from a voice channel using text commands.

It uses:
- `discord.js` for Discord integration
- `@discordjs/voice` for voice playback
- `yt-dlp` to stream YouTube audio
- `ffmpeg` for audio processing

---

## Features

- Stream YouTube audio directly into voice channels
- Maintain a queue of songs per server
- Loop the current track
- Pause/resume playback
- Skip current track
- Control volume
- Stop and disconnect from voice
- Clear the music queue

## Commands

## How It Works

1. When a user types `/play <YouTube URL>` in a text channel:
   - If nothing is playing, the bot joins the user's voice channel and plays the audio.
   - If something is already playing, it adds the song to the **queue**.

2. The bot uses `yt-dlp` to stream raw audio from YouTube and pipes it through `ffmpeg` to Discord.

3. Commands like `/skip`, `/loop`, `/pause`, and `/volume` manipulate the current playback or queue.

4. If looping is enabled via `/loop`, the same song repeats when it ends.

5. The bot automatically leaves the voice channel when playback ends and the queue is empty.
