## üéß How It Works

1. When a user types `/play <YouTube URL>` in a text channel:
   - If nothing is playing, the bot joins the user's voice channel and plays the audio.
   - If something is already playing, it adds the song to the **queue**.

2. The bot uses `yt-dlp` to stream raw audio from YouTube and pipes it through `ffmpeg` to Discord.

3. Commands like `/skip`, `/loop`, `/pause`, and `/volume` manipulate the current playback or queue.

4. If looping is enabled via `/loop`, the same song repeats when it ends.

5. The bot automatically leaves the voice channel when playback ends and the queue is empty.
